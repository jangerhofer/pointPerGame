# Team by Team X-Factor Series
## AL East
### Toronto Blue Jays: Devon Travis 2B
Devon Travis holds the keys to the Blue Jays' hopes for a third consecutive ALCS appearance. Travis has had an excellent start to his MLB career, but has seen his first two MLB seasons shortened by a mixed bag of injuries leading to playing 62 and 101 games in 2015 and 2016 respectively. A healthy season from Travis could buoy the Jays and keep them afloat after the loss of Edwin Encarnacion.

Season | GP | wRC+ | WAR
 --- | --- | --- | ---
2015 | 62 | 135 | 2.3
2016 | 101 | 109 | 2.5

Travis has had two very productive seasons most notably due to an above average bat at 2B. Even with some regression from his lofty BABIP (.354 career average) Travis will contribue on offense with a high average and moderate power. His bat along with solid defense and baserunning result in ZiPS projections of 2.5 WAR in 114 games. If Travis can stay healthy for an entire season (A HUGE if considering he's just coming back from injury to start the season), a 4 win year is not out of the question. His everyday production at 2B is crucial to Jays' success, and to keeping Darwin Barney on the bench and replacement level Ryan Goins in AAA Buffalo.


### Baltimore Orioles: Dylan Bundy SP
Dylan Bundy finally managed to stay healthy last year and appeared in 36 games (14 starts) for the Orioles, but posted only .9 WAR on a 4.70 FIP.  Bundy is a former top prospect who fell into an abyss of injuries over the past 3 years before starting his MLB career last season. The Orioles have the lineup and power to match runs with any team in the league, but badly need help in the starting rotation behind Kevin Gausman. Bundy has the potential to become part of a very strong 1-2 punch with Gausman, but the usual caveat applies: he must stay healthy.

Projections | K/9 | FIP
--- | --- | ---
Steamer | 8.00 | 4.73
ZiPS | 8.89 | 3.87

The projections diverge on Bundy with ZiPS much more optimistic across the board. After only throwing 109 inning last year Bundy will very likely not come close to approaching 200 innings, but 150-160 innings of sub-4 FIP pitching is certainly a very real possibility. He has always had dynamic "stuff", the question will be if it remains after all the injuries and time away from pitching. He posted a 10.5% SwStr% last year which is promising and supports a good K rate. Like many pitchers known for their dynamite "stuff" Bundy will have to focus on limiting walks and staying healthy.

### Boston Red Sox:  David Price  SP
Its difficult to pick an x-factor for the loaded Boston Red Sox, but David Price stands out as an extremely important cog in the direction of the team. Price signed an enormous contract last year in the offseason and followed it up with his worst season by FIP since 2009. Red Sox fans survived a Spring Training injury scare as Price avoided Tommy John surgery on a sore elbow earlier this spring. The injury, combined with the massive financial commitment makes a good season from Price all the more necessary to calm down antsy Red Sox fans, who may only be satisfied with an ALCS appearance after the huge offseason acquisition of Chris Sale.

Season | HR/FB| FIP | wFB | FB vel
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2014 | 9.7% | 2.78 | 6.3 | 93.3
2015 | 7.8% | 2.78 | 19.7 | 94.0
2016 | 13.5% | 3.60 | -2.0 | 92.9

Price saw a major increase in his HR allowed per 9 innings last season, which resulted in a significantly higher FIP. The question remains whether the majority of the jump in HRs was due to random variance, or if the move to Fenway Park has made the lefty more suseptible to long balls. Of even more concern is questions about Price's fastball. Fangraphs' pitch values shows a negative wFB (value from all fastball thrown by a pitcher) last year for what has been Price's most impressive pitch throughout his career. This decline combined with a drop in fastball velocity creates an interesting discussion about Price's value going forward, which has been further accenuated by the injury this spring. Price's health and production are critical to Boston's World Series hopes this season and for the next 6 years of his $217M contract.
