      <description>Team by Team X-Factors AL East Toronto Blue Jays: Devon Travis 2B
Devon Travis may hold the keys to the Blue Jays&amp;rsquo; hopes for a third consecutive ALCS appearance.

A healthy season from Travis could buoy the Jays and keep them afloat after the loss of Edwin Encarnacion.</description>
